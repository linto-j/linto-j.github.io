<h1>100G Leaf-Spine Data Center Fabric (with Service Leaf / Border)</h1>

<p>
This project focused on architecting and deploying a production-grade 100G leaf-spine data center fabric
using a Layer-3 underlay with BGP routing. The design was built to support high east-west throughput
(GPU / compute workloads) while also providing a controlled and secure north-south path via a
<strong>Service Leaf / Border</strong> for internet breakout and shared services.

<h2>Executive Design Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deterministic routing and fast convergence (no STP dependency)</li>
<li>High east-west throughput for compute/GPU clusters</li>
<li>Controlled north-south traffic via a Service Leaf / Border layer</li>
<li>Multi-tenant segmentation with scalable VLAN/IP structure</li>
<li>High availability with no single point of failure</li>
<li>Operational simplicity: predictable troubleshooting and growth model</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logical Topology Overview</h2>

<h2>Fabric Roles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spines</strong>: high-speed core; ECMP transit between leafs</li>
<li><strong>GPU Leafs</strong>: top-of-rack leafs for compute/GPU nodes; optimized for east-west traffic</li>
<li><strong>Service Leaf / Border</strong>: controlled north-south path to shared services and WAN/Internet breakout (often behind firewall/NAT)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why L3 Fabric Instead of L2?</h2>
<p>
A Layer-3 fabric was selected to avoid Layer-2 scaling limitations (large broadcast domains, STP complexity)
and to enable ECMP across multiple equal-cost routed paths. This provides deterministic forwarding behavior,
simplifies troubleshooting, and allows predictable scale-out by adding more leaf switches.
</p>

<h2>Routing Model</h2>
<p>
The underlay uses BGP for route exchange between leaf and spine layers. Each leaf establishes BGP peering
with all spines (or via a standardized fabric peering model), enabling full fabric reachability. ECMP
distributes flows across equal-cost paths and maintains predictable convergence behavior during failures.
</p>

<h2>North-South vs East-West Traffic Flows</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>East-West (Compute ↔ Compute)</strong>: stays within fabric; leaf-spine-leaf paths using ECMP</li>
<li><strong>North-South (Compute ↔ Internet/WAN)</strong>: steered toward the <strong>Service Leaf / Border</strong>, then to firewall/NAT and upstream</li>
<li><strong>Shared Services</strong>: DNS/NTP/management or shared networks can be anchored near the service/border zone (policy controlled)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Segmentation Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Workload segmentation aligned with tenant / environment needs</li>
<li>VLAN/IP structure designed for predictable expansion and isolation</li>
<li>Optional VRF-based separation for multi-tenant environments (where required)</li>
<li>Service/Bord​er layer used to enforce policy boundaries for north-south access</li>
</ul>

<h2>IP Addressing Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Loopbacks per device for stable routing identifiers</li>
<li>Point-to-point links (often /31) for spine-leaf interconnects</li>
<li>Clear separation of underlay addressing vs tenant/service addressing</li>
<li>Consistent naming and allocation model for operational clarity</li>
</ul>

<h2>High Availability Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dual spines + redundant uplinks from each leaf</li>
<li>ECMP-based traffic distribution and resilience</li>
<li>Failure domain isolation at leaf level</li>
<li>Service Leaf / Border redundancy (where applicable) to avoid single choke point</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>High-throughput east-west performance suited to GPU-intensive workloads</li>
<li>Deterministic routing behavior with simplified operations</li>
<li>Controlled and secure north-south breakout via Service Leaf / Border</li>
<li>Scalable architecture designed for future expansion</li>
<li>Production-grade resiliency and predictable troubleshooting</li>
</ul>
